                        <p class="text-gray-500 text-md">The Reykjanes peninsula is a natural powerhouse. Not only because of the recent volcanic activity but as the area is permanently marked by the Mid-Atlantic ridge and there are only a few places around the world – where you can see such a rift up close. See where the country is being ripped apart, inch by inch. See how the lava fields, overgrown with moss, bear witness to volcanic eruptions that happened millennia ago. This rugged beauty is home to a community that puts sustainability and innovation at its core.</p>

The hassle-free city center is safe, clean and packed with restaurants, shopping, culture and vibrant nightlife. Visiting delegates enjoy interacting with the friendly Icelanders who speak English as their second language, and often other Scandinavian and European languages.</p>

Vestfjarðaleiðin is the spectacular driving route that navigates a grand 950 km circle around the edges of this breathtaking peninsula, twisting and turning along fingers of land and occasional mountain passes, revealing grand vistas which take your breath away.</p>

                            Iceland is a country full of geological contrasts and they are best visible in the South, where geothermal heat meets glacial cold. In the Southwest and the Golden Circle Area, the heat is on, providing the energy for Iceland’s many greenhouses and swimming pools. The Southeast shows off Europe’s biggest glacier Vatnajökull, spectacular waterfalls, and black sand beaches on which the powerful waves of the North Atlantic break.
